django-apikey

Simple, straight forward API key authentication for django-piston.

Requirements:
django-piston
a User profile that has the following 2 methods:
   can_make_api_key( ), returns True is the current user can create another API key.
   available_keys( ), the number of keys that current user can create.

There is a simple template file in templates/keys.html.  This file is used
by all the project's views.


To use django-apikey with django-piston:

from key.auth import ApiKeyAuthentication
auth = ApiKeyAuthentication( )
bucket_handler = Resource( handler=MyHandler, authentication=auth )


Clients use the Authorization header to pass the API key:

headers['Authorization'] = 'your.api.key.here'
